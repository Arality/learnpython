# In this lesson we cover the basic data types and how to use them.
# Before we get started it is important to note anything written behind the hashtags(#) is treated as a comment in python
# which means when we run our program it will ignore anything behind them

#     Integers
#     An integer is any whole number and the computer treats it how you would treat numbers for now igrnore the print()
#     we'll cover this later but it's called a function what's important right now is that is going to show us things on the screen when we use it
# print(5)

#     Floats
#     A float is any decimal number ex: 5.2 
# print(8.5)

#     Char
#     A charcter is any single letter, encased by ' ' marks
# print('C')

#     Strings
#     A string is any amount of text encased by " " marks
# print("This is a string, notice how we need the quotation marks")

#     Bool
#     A boolean is binary number. Which means either True or False
# print(True)

#     Variables
#     A variable can hold one of the above types and allow you to work with it
#     let's say we want to make a variable called var and give it the integer 8
# var = 8
# print(var)

    # Lists
    # A list is a variable collection of items seperated by a , surrounded by [] 
    # the number inside the brackets[0], starting at 0 determine which item in the list you are refering
    # to while and empty [] referse to the entire list as an object
# newList = ["List item 1", "List item 2", "List item 3"]
# print(newList)
#print(newList[0])

    # Dictonaries
    # A dictonary creates a list of items you can access through a key name then : then a data type with a , seperating items surrounded by {}
# newDictStateCapitals = {
#     "Arizona" : "Phoenix",
#     "Colorado" : "Denver",
#     "New Mexico" : "Santa Fe",
#     "California" : "Sacramento"
# }
# print(newDictStateCapitals)
# print(newDictStateCapitals["Arizona"])
# print(newDictStateCapitals["Phoenix"])
