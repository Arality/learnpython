# 2.1 Math
#     Addition
#     Addition works just as you would expect it torepresented by +
# print(5 + 5)

#     Subtraction
#     Subtraction works the same as you would expect it torepresented by -
# print(20 - 10)

#     Multiplication
#     Multiplication works the same as you would expect it torepresented by *
# print(5 * 5)

#     Division 
#     Division works the same as you would expect it torepresented by /
# print(100 / 25)

#     Modulo
#     Modulo only gives you the remainder of a Division represented by %
# print(100 % 23)

#     Exponents
#     Raises a number to the powerrepresented by **
# print(2 ** 5)

# 2.2 Comparison
#     Equal
#     Equal compares two items and returns true or false represented by ==
# print(5 == 10)

#   Equal
#   There is anoer way to use equals, when you are creating an assignment. Say if we want to set a variable to be something
# x = 5
# print(x) 

#     != Not Equal
#     No equal is the exact oposite of equal compares two items and returns true or False represented by !=
# print(5 != 10)

#     Less Than
#     Less Than returns true if the expression is less than represented by <
# print(5 < 10)

#     Greater Than
#     Greater Than returns true if the expression is greater than represented by >
# print(5 > 10)

#     Less than or equal to
#     Less than or equal to returns true if they are less than or equal to. Represented by <=
# print(5 <= 10)

#     >=  Greater than or equal to
#     Greater than or equal to returns true if they are greater than or equal to. Represented by >=
# print(5 >= 10)


# 2.3 Logic
#     not
#     Returns true if two values are logically reversed
# print(not False)

#     or
#     Returns true if either expression is true represented by or
# print(True or False)

#     and
#     Only returns true if both expressions are true otherwise false represented by and
# print(True and True)

# 2.4 Bitwise
#     &
#     Logical and returns true only if both expressions are true represented by &
# print(True and True & True or False)

#     | or
#     Logical or returns true if either of the expressions returns true
# print(True or True | True and False)

    # in
    # Returns true if and object is found in another object
# print(1 in [0, 1, 2])
# print('a' in "abc")
